## How to Showcase Your Collection of Products and Services with Product Portfolio Examples

Younger, growing companies with small product portfolios may not possess many of the star or cash-cow products that mature companies use as capital for innovation initiatives. 

In fact, when youâ€™re running a smaller organization, the quality of your product portfolio management is even more critical. Many factors determine the quality of that management: 

- Are you allocating your resources appropriately? 
- How well are you measuring market attractiveness?
- How efficiently are you cutting waste?
- How skilled are you at identifying products with the best potential for market success? 

When your company has fewer products, any instability will deeply impact your business operations.
